# Local Storage Table

Local Storage Table is an Electron-based application that allows you to store CSV data in the local machine's Local Storage and search it easily.

##  Features
It converts CSV data into a table and stores it in Local Storage, without sending it externally.

You can easily refine search results in the table.  
This makes it easier to search than directly searching the CSV file.
